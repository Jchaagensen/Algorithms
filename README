A collection of exploratory algorithms for SETI.

Information
------------------------------------------------
This codebase uses the cross-platform CMake build system.
Currently, the code depends on the FFTW and GSL libraries; they are required for compilation.

Code organization:

- sq_utils contains some simple routines that aren't strictly DSP-related but 'enable' stuff such
as proper read and write of data to be done so that it plays well with the seti data format. It 
also includes some useful computational utilities.

- sq_constants has a bunch of useful constants used throughout the library as preprocessor defines.

- sq_dsp contains DSP code that performs operations such as FFT, power calculation, windowing,
and more.

- sq_imaging has functions to handle image processing, reading, and writing.

- sq_signals contains generator functions for various signals.

Compiling
------------------------------------------------
Before compiling, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
FFTW and GSL are required.
On Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 (tested), install the libfftw3-dev and libgsl0-dev packages.

To build, create a directory anywhere in your filesystem and inside it, run:

cmake /path/to/SETIkit/directory/

Now you'll see a bunch of files generated by CMake.

Run `make` to build.
Run `make install` (as root) to install.

(This is an example of an out-of-source build. The files generated by 
project configuration and compilation do not clutter the source directory).
