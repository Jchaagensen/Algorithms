A collection of exploratory algorithms for SETI.

Information
------------------------------------------------
This codebase uses the cross-platform CMake build system.
Currently, the code depends on the FFTW and GSL libraries; they are required for compilation.

Compiling
------------------------------------------------
Before compiling, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
On Ubuntu, install the libfftw3-dev and libgsl0-dev packages.

To build, create a directory anywhere in your filesystem and inside it, run:

cmake /path/to/SETIkit/source/directory/

Now you'll see a bunch of files generated by CMake.

Run `make` to build.

Now in the current directory, navigate to bin/ to find all executables.

(This is an example of an out-of-source build. The files generated by 
project configuration and compilation do not clutter the source directory).
